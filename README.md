# ConnectToPowerBIDatasetsViaPython
This code is for the Analysts that would like to retrieve data from Power BI datasets. The Capacity Metrics dataset can be one of the datasets of interest. This dataset contains all the information related to the Power BI Embedded Capacities. This data is very important for use in monitoring the capacity utilization and consumption associated with collective sets of reports, and therefore helpful in supporting capacity planning along with resulting decisions. 

In this script is also described how to send the retrieved data to storage accounts (For example Blob Storage) so that it can be consumed by other services.
